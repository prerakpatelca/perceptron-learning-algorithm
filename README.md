# Perceptron Learning Algorithm
Explored the use of perceptrons and multi-layer perceptrons on both artificial and real data sets. In this python script in which we developed the code for the perceptron learning algorithm and then test it on the data sets.

000825410_1.csv, 000825410_2.csv this two files are linearly seperable and I have
determined that using the accuracy of Perceptron Learning Algorithm to solve the dataset. Whilst, other two files 000825410_3.csv, 000825410_4.csv has the accuracy just above 50% which says that the files are not linerly seperable.
